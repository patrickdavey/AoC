# Advent of code

My solutions to the wonderful [http://adventofcode.com/](http://adventofcode.com/) . 

If you're looking for beautiful code, this probably isn't the place to look, but at least it all worked for me.
After completing puzzles I looked around at other solutions, and, if you want to see some really elegant solutions, I can recommend https://github.com/ahorner/advent-of-code

Many thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for the most excellent Advent of Code.
